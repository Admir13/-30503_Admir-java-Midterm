Answer:Insertion, deletion,Searching,Sorting

When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer:

What is an Array?
Answer:An array is a collection of similar data elements stored at contiguous memory locations

What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer:Array is a fixed length data structure, ArrayList is a variable length Collection class

Answer:

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When does it occur?
Answer:The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is one of the most common errors in Java.

       Using clone() method.
       Using arraycopy() method.
       Using copyOf() method of Arrays class.

What is DFS and BFS?
Answer: DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
BFS is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property.

What is Recursion?
Answer:The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion.
Recursion is an technique
with the help of which we can reduce the length of our code and make it easier to read and write.

What are linear and non-linear data Structures?
Answer:A linear data structure includes arrays, linked lists,queues and stacks.
A non-linear data structure is made up of trees and graphs.
