***ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS BELOW***

Why do we need data structure?
Answer: Data structure provides a way of organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently.
With the help of data structure, the data items can be traversed easily.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?
Answer:Insertion, deletion,Searching,Sorting

When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer:

What is an Array?
Answer:An array is a collection of similar data elements stored at contiguous memory locations

What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer:Array is a fixed length data structure, ArrayList is a variable length Collection class

What is a LinkedList?
Answer:A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer:

What is a Queue?
Answer:

What is a Stack (referring to data structures)?
Answer:

What is FIFO and LIFO?
Answer:

Explain Big O Notation?
Answer:

What is the best case to search an element from an array?
Answer:

What is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer:

Describe what a tree data structure is?
Answer:A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure
consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores
a value and a list of references to other nodes (the 'children').
This data structure is a specialized method to organize
and store data in the computer to be used more effectively

Describe what a graph data structure is?
Answer:A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.



What is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Answer:HashMap is non-synchronized. It is not thread-safe and
can’t be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code
 Hashtable is synchronized. It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads.
 HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesn’t allow any null key or value.
 HashMap is generally preferred over HashTable if thread synchronization is not needed.


How do HashMaps work in Java? How do they store values, and when are they useful?
Answer:HashMap is a part of the Java collection framework. It uses a technique called Hashing.
       It implements the map interface. It stores the data in the pair of Key and Value.
       HashMap contains an array of the nodes, and the node is represented as a class.
        It uses an array and LinkedList data structure internally for storing Key and Value.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When does it occur?
Answer:The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is one of the most common errors in Java.
It occurs when a program attempts to access an invalid index in an array
an index that is less than 0, or equal to or greater than the length of the array

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Answer:Iterating each element of the given original array and copy one element at a time.
       Using clone() method.
       Using arraycopy() method.
       Using copyOf() method of Arrays class.

What is DFS and BFS?
Answer: DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
BFS is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property.

What is Recursion?
Answer:The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion.
Recursion is an technique
with the help of which we can reduce the length of our code and make it easier to read and write.

What are linear and non-linear data Structures?
Answer:A linear data structure includes arrays, linked lists,queues and stacks.
A non-linear data structure is made up of trees and graphs.
